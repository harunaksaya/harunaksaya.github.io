    <h2>For The Record!!</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        I'm someone who truly loves working and creating. Whether it's diving into research, developing new projects, or exploring innovative ideas in technology and education, I find joy in the process of building and producing meaningful work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond my professional life, I'm passionate about <strong>nature</strong>, <strong>coffee</strong>, and <strong>cycling</strong>. There's something special about a good cup of coffee that fuels my day, a bike ride that clears my mind, and the beauty of nature that keeps me grounded. These simple pleasures remind me of what truly matters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Above all, <strong>family</strong> is at the center of my life. They are my source of strength, motivation, and happiness. Everything I do is enriched by the love and support of those closest to me.
