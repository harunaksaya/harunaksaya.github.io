  The university climate, which is a symbol of maintaining the tradition of multidisciplinary studies, is important in terms of ensuring sustainable success in health services through the adaptation of driving forces of change in the field of informatics to the field of medicine. Big data in healthcare, internet of things, biosensors and wearable technologies, artificial intelligence and cloud computing accelerate digital transformation processes and provide opportunities for effective time and resource management. The use of medical informatics technologies in health services, where effective use of time and resource management is mandatory, will not only accelerate business processes but also reduce human-caused errors. Data flowing from all medical objects creates big data; analyzing big data with artificial intelligence and machine learning provides access to structured information that can be used in the healthcare field. With knowledge management, it will make a great contribution to creating disease maps, establishing national health profiles and determining health policies. On the one hand, a digital hospital model that provides integrated health services is developing, where all kinds of medical products can send data to the information management system through networks and sensors, and patients and health personnel can access the information in this system from the health institution or remotely with their authorities and approvals. On the other hand, thanks to remote monitoring systems, health services are transforming from hospital-oriented to patient-oriented health services. By adapting health informatics capabilities to medical and institutional management processes, autonomous systems that can manage, control and optimize themselves in the health system can provide solutions in preventing cost increases in health institutions where the most intensive resource use occurs, and will contribute to increased efficiency and quality.
