  Decision support systems entered the literature in the 1960s. Since then, they have gained an increased importance with the development of technology and internet. These systems have facilitated the decision-making processes of managers in many areas ranging from education, health, finance to defense. Today, they have become much more capable thanks to the dramatic increase in digital data and artificial learning technologies. One of the areas where human mistake is irreversible and costly is the health sector. Clinical decision support systems not only minimize human errors but also process much more data and make more accurate decisions. These systems help doctors and nurses in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. These systems also facilitate the decision-making processes of managers in managerial processes such as human resources management, process management, and financial management. A comprehensive digital transformation is needed to implement clinical decision support systems in an institution. This transformation includes technological transformation, individual employee transformation, and transformation of corporate culture. Although the transformation process is quite costly and time consuming, there are many more benefits of a successful digital transformation. Thanks to the developing and widespread mobile technologies, digital health assistants have entered our mobile phones. These assistants work on the phone, collect data about their users, and assist their users in their diagnosis processes. With the digitalization in the field of health, we will be able to have much more digital data. By using artificial intelligence technologies, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms, we will be able to develop decision support systems that will make much more accurate decisions, facilitate clinical and administrative processes, and minimize human errors.
