  In this study, an aspect-based sentiment analysis study was conducted using the comment data collected from the okul.com.tr platform. First, comments were collected on okul.com.tr platform. Aspects in each comment have been identified. Each comment is tagged by adding the moods of aspects. This labeling process was controlled by four different people. After the labeling process is completed, the process of creating the model has begun. A machine learning model has been developed using multilayer artificial neural networks. Some of the labeled comment data (70%) were used for the training of the model, and the other part (30%) was used for testing the model. 95% success was achieved on the data set used with the model.
