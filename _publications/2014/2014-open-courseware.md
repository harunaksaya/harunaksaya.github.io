  TL;DR: This thesis examines open courseware platforms from the perspective of lifelong learning. It identifies the absence of a global accreditation body but highlights the existence of independent development and presentation guidelines among leading international open courseware platforms. Based on these, a draft evaluation form for open courseware platforms was developed using Lawshe's (1975) model.
