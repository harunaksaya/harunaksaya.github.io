  Especially with the development of Web 2.0 technologies, the capabilities of the internet environment have significantly increased, and internet-based applications have been developed in many different areas from education to health, from communication to business life. Today, many educational institutions offer courses free of charge over the network. With the development of these presentation formats, the phenomenon of Open Course Ware has emerged, along with the Open University approach. This approach eliminates spatial and temporal boundaries, allowing anyone to receive education on any subject they desire. This project, initiated by MIT in 2000, is now being implemented by many universities around the world. The necessity of examining the qualities and effectiveness of such projects has also emerged. The problem of this study is the lack of a qualified scale to evaluate Open Course Ware Platforms, which are currently seen as a service provided by many educational institutions. The aim of this study is to develop a valid scale for evaluating open course ware platforms. For this purpose, (1) a literature study on open course ware standards was conducted, (2) forms, scales and guides for measurement and evaluation obtained from the literature were examined, (3) a draft form consisting of 172 items in two sections was developed by researchers based on the data obtained, (4) expert groups were formed, (5) the draft form was presented to experts and their evaluations were requested, (6) expert opinions were obtained, (7) content validity ratios for the items were calculated.
